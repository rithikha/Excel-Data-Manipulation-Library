# CPSC312 Haskell Project

We used explored the feasability of using Haskell to recreate basic Excel functions (Note that the excel document given to the program must follow a specific format as shown in the example sheet)

The Data Maniplation Library contaisn the following functions:

select_row :: Int -> [a] -> a

select_column

sum_row

average_row

min_row

max_row

min_column

max_column

select_value

read_int

row_name

column_name

row_column_name

Row_column

compare_values

Compare_columns

Compare-rows
